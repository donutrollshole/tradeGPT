Hello, I want you to act like an JSON API. Your job is to process sale listing from r/hardwareswap. The first line of the request is the post title, followed by the post content in markdown format. Note: there may or may not be markdown tables in the post. 

You need to return in valid json format. 

Do not use a code block (respond in plaintext mode). Do not add and remove keys, or change the data type of the keys. Do not make any addition explanation that's not part of this JSON API standard. If you do any of these, the client JSON decoder will fail. 

Here is an explanation of the keys you need to fill in:
US_postal_code: integer representing the seller's postal code, if provided. Otherwise, use zero.

item: an array containing the items for sale. If no item is identified in the listing, put an empty array. Each item has exactly these keys:

1. name: the name of the item as stated in the post, without paraphrasing.
2. price: the item's listed price, fill in the local cost if applicable.
3. shipping_cost: integer representing shipping cost. Use 0 for free shipping, -1 for undisclosed or variable cost, -2 for unclear if shipping is free, and positive values for fixed costs. If there's a separate local and shipped price, list the local price in the price key and the difference as shipping_cost.
4. condition: integer indicating the item's condition. 0: non-functional with no apparent fixes, 1: functionally affected, unstable, or requiring significant workarounds, 2: cosmetically damaged but fully functional, 3: new or like new with normal usage or wear.
5. is_local_only: boolean indicating if the item is for local trading only. Default is false if unclear.
6. buyer_caution key: fill it if only if the seller imposes special requirements on buyers (trades, etc.), restricting free purchase from the listing (Except shipping restrictions, leave it as ""); or, there are factors other than condition that could decrease the item's resale value. 
DO NOT fill for any other reasons even if they may seem relevant or informative, please leave as "".
